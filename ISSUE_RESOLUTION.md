# Issue Resolution: Database Synchronization Conflict

## Problem Description
After successfully running the database migration, the application was failing to start with the following error:
```
QueryFailedError: column "userId" of relation "products" contains null values
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a **conflict between migrations and schema synchronization**:

1. **Migration Successfully Executed**: The migration `1700000000000-CreateUserProductRelationship.ts` successfully created the database schema with proper foreign key relationships.

2. **Schema Synchronization Conflict**: The application had `synchronize: true` in `app.module.ts`, which caused TypeORM to try to synchronize the existing database schema with the entity definitions.

3. **Database Name Mismatch**: There was a mismatch between the database names in different configuration files:
   - `app.module.ts`: `e-commerce_backend`
   - `data-source.ts` and migration: `e_commerce`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Schema Synchronization
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
synchronize: true, // Set to false in production

// After (fixed)
synchronize: false, // Set to false when using migrations
```

**Why this fixes the issue**: When using migrations, you should set `synchronize: false` to prevent TypeORM from automatically trying to modify the database schema. This avoids conflicts between the migration-created schema and entity-based synchronization.

### 2. Fixed Database Name Consistency
```typescript
// Before (mismatch)
database: 'e-commerce_backend',

// After (consistent)
database: 'e_commerce',
```

**Why this is important**: Database names must be consistent across all configuration files to ensure proper connectivity.

## Current Status
✅ **Issue Resolved**: Application starts successfully without database errors
✅ **Migration Working**: Database schema is properly established
✅ **Relationships Active**: User-Product foreign key relationship is functional
✅ **Application Running**: NestJS application is running on port 9000

## Database Schema Status
- **users table**: ✅ Created with proper structure and constraints
- **products table**: ✅ Created with proper foreign key to users
- **Foreign key constraint**: ✅ Active with CASCADE operations
- **Indexes**: ✅ Automatically created by PostgreSQL
- **Enum types**: ✅ `users_role_enum` created successfully

## Best Practices for Future
1. **Always use `synchronize: false`** when working with migrations
2. **Keep database names consistent** across all configuration files
3. **Test migrations in development** before applying to production
4. **Backup database** before running migrations
5. **Use migrations for schema changes** instead of automatic synchronization

## Migration Commands Available
```bash
# Run migrations
npm run migration:run

# Revert last migration
npm run migration:revert

# Generate new migration
npm run migration:generate -- -n MigrationName

# Sync schema (use with caution)
npm run schema:sync
```

## Entity Relationship Established
```
User (1) ←→ (Many) Product
```
- One user (seller) can have many products
- Each product belongs to exactly one user (seller)
- Products are automatically deleted when their seller is deleted (CASCADE)
